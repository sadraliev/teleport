**Project Title:**  
"Teleport: A Bridge for Native App and WebView Interaction"

**Project Description:**  
"Teleport" is a bridge that enables seamless interaction between a native mobile application and its embedded WebView. This bridge provides a communication channel for the website (inside the WebView) to access the hardware capabilities of the device, allowing for enhanced features and a richer user experience.

With "Teleport," the web content running inside the WebView can call native functions such as camera access, geolocation services, push notifications, and device sensors. It brings the power of native functionalities to web-based content, making hybrid apps more capable and interactive.

**Key Features & Capabilities:**
- **Camera Access:** Websites inside the WebView can trigger the device’s camera to scan QR codes, take pictures, or record videos.
- **Geolocation:** Web pages can request the device’s current location using native geolocation services, enabling location-based features in the web content.
- **Push Notifications:** The WebView can interact with the native push notification system, sending alerts to users even when the web content is not actively displayed.
- **File System Access:** Websites can interact with the device’s local storage or filesystem, enabling file uploads or downloads directly from the WebView.
- **Sensors Integration:** Websites can utilize sensors like accelerometers, gyroscopes, or proximity sensors to create interactive, real-time experiences.
- **Native UI Elements:** WebView content can invoke native UI elements (like native pickers or modals) to improve the overall user interface and experience.
- **Biometric Authentication:**
  - Face ID: Enable users to authenticate with Face ID (Apple's facial recognition) directly within the WebView, providing a secure and seamless login experience for web content.
  - Fingerprint Authentication: Use Touch ID to authenticate users via fingerprint recognition, offering a quick and secure method for access to web-based services inside the WebView.

**Benefits:**
- Provides a unified experience where both native and web content can work together seamlessly.
- Enhances the capability of web content inside mobile apps, bridging the gap between the web and native features.
- Makes hybrid applications more powerful without compromising on the rich capabilities offered by native development.

**Use Cases:**
- **E-commerce Apps:** Integrating WebView for product pages while enabling native features like camera scanning for barcodes or QR codes.
- **Social Media Apps:** Web pages in the app can access the camera or microphone for media upload, real-time location tracking, and geolocation-based features.
- **Business Apps:** Allowing a WebView to interact with native services like device storage for file handling, and sensor data for dynamic content adjustments.

**Technologies Involved:**  
- **WKWebView** for embedding web content in iOS apps.
- **JavaScript** bridge for communication between WebView and native iOS code.
- **Native APIs** for accessing device hardware features like camera, geolocation, and sensors.

By enabling this integration, "Teleport" makes it possible for hybrid applications to offer a more native-like experience, giving web content inside the WebView access to the device's powerful capabilities.
